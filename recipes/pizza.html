    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.<br> 
        This is a classic homemade pizza recipe, including a pizza dough recipe, topping suggestions, and step-by-step instructions with photos.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4th cup of Flour</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps-</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475Â°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
        <li>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.</li>
        <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>
